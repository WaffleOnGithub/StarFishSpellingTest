# StarFishSpellingTest
A spelling test for kids :)
Using tkinter & python 

 


//python files should start with speeling_test_ (for example "spelling_test_gui",spelling_test_database")

//declare variables at the start of the program and add a quick comment describing it

//Comment on new lines of code (not repeated lines though)

//use snake_case for variable identifiers

//no single letter variables("x","a") identifiers should be relevent and easy to understand

//functions should also be sensibly named

//agreed to write what you changed on what date
